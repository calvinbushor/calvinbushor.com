                  <p>This is a question I asked my leadership team looking to challenge all of us to think deeper about what our strengths truly are. (Learn the Super Power Discovery activity.) Usually, when others are asked what their strengths are, most people will say the usual lame stuff like, “I am hardworking,” or “I am always on time,” and people rarely go deeper than the surface to figure out what really sets them apart. Guess what? Most people...</p>

This was a very fun conference where top technologists around the country presented the latest and greatest in tech. IOT (internet of things) was really big this year, demonstrating where the world is going with connecting everything to the internet.</p>

                <p>I presented <a class="hLink" href="https://speakerdeck.com/calvinbushor/api-strategery">"API Strategery"</a>, a talk focused on REST APIs and why decoupling your UI from your applications logic enables you to do so much more in the future. Today, this is an old concept, but so many of us fail by putting our application logic so close to our UIs. This really limits our ability to innovate and pivot when we realize new ideas and opportunities. "API Strategery" was recieved well at Michigan Dev Fest and it was a fun presentation to give.</p>
